Brief Introduction About Myself

[Write 1-2 paragraphs about yourself here. For example:]

Hello! My name is [Your Name] and I'm currently learning about version control and GitHub. I'm excited to start my journey in software development and collaboration using Git and GitHub.

This introduction file is part of my first GitHub repository, where I'm practicing the basics of creating repositories, adding files, and making commits. I look forward to building more projects and contributing to the open-source community as I continue learning.
